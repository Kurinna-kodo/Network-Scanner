# Network Scanner Project

## Project Overview

This project consists of a Python script for scanning networks, identifying active devices, and checking for open ports on those devices. It's designed to help in network analysis, troubleshooting, and security assessments.

## Features

- Network discovery using ARP requests
- Port scanning with TCP connection attempts
- Parallel scanning for efficiency

## Usage

[Provide instructions on how to use the script, including any installation requirements, command-line arguments, etc.]

## Credits

The initial version of this script was developed with guidance from OpenAI's ChatGPT, which provided the foundational code for the network scanning and port checking functionalities. I have since made modifications to improve performance, add new features, and tailor the script to specific use cases.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to OpenAI's ChatGPT for providing a strong foundation in network scanning techniques and port checking logic. This project builds upon that foundation with enhancements and optimizations for practical use.
